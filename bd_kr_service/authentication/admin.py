# This is a Django admin configuration file. It is used to register models that will be
# displayed in the Django admin interface.

# The "admin" module is a part of Django's admin site, which provides a user-friendly
# interface for managing data in Django-powered applications.
from django.contrib import admin

# The "register" function is used to register models with the Django admin site.
# In this file, we will be registering any models that we want to be able to manage
# through the Django admin interface.
#
# For example, if we had a model called "MyModel" that we wanted to manage through the
# Django admin interface, we would call "admin.site.register(MyModel)" here.
#
# admin.site.register(MyModel)

# Since we don't have any specific models to register in this example, we simply
# leave this comment as a placeholder for future development.
# Register your models here.
